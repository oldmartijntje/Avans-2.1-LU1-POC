# Workflows

Workflows are `.yml` files that automate tasks when something happens in your repository, like pushing a commit to a branch.

We have multiple workflows in this repo.

1. `deploy.yml` is the workflow that hosts our backend on our vps, with automatic deployment. You can learn how it works and how to set it up [in this article](./deploy_workflow.md)
